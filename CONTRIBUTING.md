## ⚙️ Build and Compile the Source

> [!TIP]  
> Please confirm that your development environment meets the requirements before compiling.

### 1. 🖥️ Visual Studio 2022

Ensure that your installation includes the appropriate workloads:

- On the **Workloads** tab of the Visual Studio installer, check:
  - **.NET Desktop Development**
  - **WinUI Application Development**

### 2. 🛠️ .NET SDKs

Ensure that you have both of the following installed:

- .NET **8.x**
- .NET **9.x**

### 3. 📂 Solution Format (SLNX)

This project uses the new **`.slnx`** solution format.

> ⚠️ This feature is currently in preview — enable it in Visual Studio:  
> **Tools → Options → Preview Features → Use the new solution format (`.slnx`)**

### 4. Installed the **XAML Styler** extension (Optional for Building, Required for Contribute):  
  [XAML Styler for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler2022)


Make sure your environment matches these requirements to avoid issues during compilation.

## 🖌 Code Style & Formatting

- **All XAML files** must be formatted using [XAML Styler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler2022)
- The settings are defined in `settings.xamlstyler` located in the root directory.
- Run **XAML Styler** on any new or updated XAML files before committing.

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Build Artifacts

To fix certain Visual Studio issues when switching between `Debug` and `Release`:

- After Swithcing, Close Visual Studio and Use the `Clean-obj-bin.bat` script to clean all `bin/` and `obj/` folders.

---

## 🚀 Debug and Release Configuration

- **Debug** builds target only `.NET 9` for faster development.
- **Release** builds target both `.NET 8` and `.NET 9`, and will automatically generate a NuGet package in `Output/`.

## 🧱 Project Details

### 📁 DevWinUI (Core Library)

Contains:
- Attached properties
- Helpers
- Native methods
- Services
- Extensions
- Managers

> ❌ No XAML or theme files in this project.

---

### 📁 DevWinUI.Controls (Control Library)

Contains all XAML-related functionality:
- Custom controls
- Styles, brushes, converters
- Win2D-based controls

#### ➕ Adding a New Control

1. Create the `.cs` control file in one of these folders:
   - `Controls/`: General controls
   - `Others/`: If no specific category
   - A new folder (optional) if it includes multiple files

2. Add the XAML style to:
   - `Themes/Styles/Controls/`: General controls
   - `Themes/Styles/Win2d/`: Win2D-based controls

3. Create a Style with two parts:

- Default style with key:

```xml
<Style x:Key="DefaultMyControlStyle"
       TargetType="local:MyControl">
    <!-- Setters, Templates, etc. -->
</Style>
```
- Override as implicit style:
```xml
<Style BasedOn="{StaticResource DefaultMyControlStyle}"
       TargetType="local:MyControl" />
```
- 🧱 Register the Default Style in Code
In your control's constructor, set the `DefaultStyleKey`:

```cs
public MyControl()
{
    this.DefaultStyleKey = typeof(MyControl);
}
```

4. ⚠ Don't Forget
Do not include code-behind `(x:Class)` in any XAML files intended for `Generic`.xaml. Use `ResourceDictionary` only.

The files under `Themes/Styles/**` are automatically included in `Generic.xaml` by the build process.

Avoid placing the implicit style directly in `Generic.xaml` 
— it is auto-generated by the `XAMLTools.MSBuild` package.

> [!TIP]
> These folders are **automatically included** in `Generic.xaml` via the `XAMLTools.MSBuild` NuGet package:

- Themes\Styles
- Controls\Ported

> [!CAUTION]
> 🔒 Do not manually edit `Generic.xaml`. It is auto-generated.

### 📁 DevWinUI.ContextMenu
- A .NET Standard class library that supports WinUI, WPF, WinForms, etc.
- Uses a binary-only DLL (ContextMenuCustomHost.dll) due to licensing.
- Do not edit or remove this file.

### 📁 DevWinUI.Gallery (Sample App)
#### ➕ Add a New Sample Page
- Add a new .xaml page in:
`dev/DevWinUI.Gallery/Views/Pages/`
Use a subfolder based on category:

```bash
Features/
LandingPages/
Win2d/
Common/
```
- Update the XAML:
```xml
<Page x:Class="DevWinUIGallery.Views.YourPage"
      xmlns:dev="using:DevWinUI"
      xmlns:local="using:DevWinUIGallery">
```

- Update the code-behind namespace:

```cs
namespace DevWinUIGallery.Views;
```

- Add a `<ControlExample>` block inside the page like this:

```xml
<ScrollViewer>
  <StackPanel Margin="10"
            dev:PanelAttach.ChildrenTransitions="Default"
            Spacing="10">
    <local:ControlExample DocPage="yourcontrol" HeaderText="YourControl">
        <local:ControlExample.Xaml>
            <x:String>
                &lt;dev:YourControl Property="Value" /&gt;
            </x:String>
        </local:ControlExample.Xaml>
        <dev:YourControl />
    </local:ControlExample>
  </StackPanel>
</ScrollViewer>
```
> [!TIP]
> 📂 Browse other sample pages for examples.

- Add the sample entry to `Assets/NavViewMenu/AppData.json`:
```json
{
  "UniqueId": "DevWinUIGallery.Views.YourPage",
  "Title": "YourControl",
  "Subtitle": "YourControl",
  "IsNew": true,
  "ImagePath": "ms-appx:///Assets/Fluent/Viewbox.png"
}
```

- Rebuild the solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> 🧹 Clean up any auto-added ItemGroup Removed/Included/... lines in the .`csproj`.

### 📌 Project Versioning
Versions are controlled centrally in `Directory.Build.props` with properties like:

```xml
<LibraryMajorVersion>8</LibraryMajorVersion>
<DevWinUI_MinorVersion>4</DevWinUI_MinorVersion>
<DevWinUI_PatchVersion>1</DevWinUI_PatchVersion>
<IsPreviewBuild>false</IsPreviewBuild>
```
It also defines:
- NuGet metadata
- Supported platforms
- Shared configuration settings

### 🔖 DevWinUI Namespace

In **DevWinUI**, all code (regardless of folder depth or purpose) should use the root namespace:

```csharp
namespace DevWinUI;
```
In XAML, always declare:

```xml
xmlns:local="using:DevWinUI"
```
Avoid deeper namespaces like DevWinUI.Controls, DevWinUI.Blah, etc.

### 🧼 Code Guidelines
#### ✂️ Partial Classes
All control and helper classes must be marked as `partial` to support Native `AOT`.

```cs
public partial class MyControl : Control
{
    // ...
}

```
#### 🚫 Avoid Reflection
Avoid using reflection-based logic, or any indirect type access. These break Native AOT compatibility.

### ⚠ Notes
- Do not include ItemGroup Removed/Included/... auto-generated lines in .csproj.
- Do not touch `Themes/Generic.xaml` — it's generated.
- Follow folder structure and naming conventions.
- Format all XAML using the provided styler configuration.
- Use Single `DevWinUI` namespace.
- Follow Native AOT recomended
